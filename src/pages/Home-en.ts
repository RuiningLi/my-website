  TITLE_1: "Ray / Ruining Li",
  BRIEF_1: `I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford</a> 
    <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/" target="_blank">VGG</a>, advised by Prof. 
    <a href='https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/' target="_blank">Andrea Vedaldi</a> and Prof. 
    <a href='https://chrirupp.github.io/' target="_blank">Christian Rupprecht</a> and funded by Toshiba. 
    My research primarily focuses on 3D Computer Vision, a field that aims to develop machine learning
    models that reconstruct, understand, and generate physical scenes and objects. 
    I am particularly passionate about learning such models from other sources than ground-truth
    3D data, such as images, videos, and large pre-trained models. I am broadly interested
    in machine learning and always glad to meet new people and hear about potential collaborations.`,
  BRIEF_2: `Before starting my PhD, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 
    the same university, during which I was introduced to research by Dr. 
    <a href="https://elliottwu.com/">Shangzhe Wu</a>.`,
